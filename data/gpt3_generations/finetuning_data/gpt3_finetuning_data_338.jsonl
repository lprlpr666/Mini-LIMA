They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, which usually excludes dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).\nOutput:", "completion": " science<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Expand the following outline into an article.\nTitle: Great Habits For Kids To Have Early In Life\nOutline: First, give an overall introduction. Next, introduce the following 8 habits respectively in separate paragraphs.\n- reading\n- staying alive\n- remaining positive\n- respect\n- honesty \n- gratefulness\n- family togetherness\n- cleanliness\n\n", "completion": "Most parents are well aware that telling children what to do and how to act is far less effective than showing them what to do and how to act. Teaching children what is a good habit early in life works best when the habit or behavior is modeled by the parents themselves. Whether the child is 3 or 13, kids look to their parents for guidance, so consider these 8 great habits for kids to develop early in life.\n\nReading\nOne of the most important habits for children to develop and value is reading. Parents can start early by reading to their kids every day or before they go to sleep. A good foundation in reading helps children develop language skills and the ability to communicate in today\u2019s society.\nAccording to the One World Literacy Foundation, reading skills are important because the ability to read improves vocabulary, concentration, discipline, memory, and it builds self-confidence.\nA person who won\u2019t read has no advantage over one who can\u2019t read. -Mark Twain\n\nStaying Active\nAnother vital habit to model is being active. Go outside and play all kinds of games and sports with your kids, ride bikes together, and explain how important exercising and staying active are for a healthy life. Kids who are active are less likely to develop obesity or sleep issues.\nIn addition, avoid being a couch potato yourself. Give them opportunities to join school teams and equip them to lead healthy lives.\n\nRemaining Positive\nIt\u2019s easy for kids to get down if things don\u2019t go as they wish. Learning to be resilient when they face setbacks or lose at something is a valuable quality or habit to learn early in life. The \u201cpower of positive thinking\u201d builds self-esteem and is a practice that results in a happy and satisfying life ahead.\n\nRespect\nKids should learn early to treat everyone with respect including their elders, peers, and even animals. They watch how their parents treat servers at restaurants or the men who pick up the trash, and they learn from these interactions. Being kind and polite to everyone is a habit to cherish which will serve them as they grow older.\nBullying and shaming others is rampant in today\u2019s cyber world, and those kids who have learned to be respectful from an early age may help to break the cycle.\n\nHonesty\nAlways tell the truth. Own up to mistakes and accept the consequences. Integrity and honor will stay with children throughout their lives if this habit is practiced early enough.\nAlways do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest. -Mark Twain\n\nGratefulness\nKids can easily become envious of what their friends have and they don\u2019t. Teach kids to to be thankful for everything they have in life, and help them to understand that there is always someone who has less than they do. Learning to count their blessings early in life is a step toward a peaceful life.\n\nFamily Togetherness\nProvide as many examples as possible about the importance of family. Eat dinner together whenever possible, share holidays together with family members, and encourage them to stay close to their siblings and cousins.  \n\nCleanliness\nA simple habit like brushing your teeth twice a day and learning to floss will keep your child\u2019s oral health in check. Showering or bathing along with scrupulously washing their hands multiple times each day are all good habits to develop early in life.<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Summarize the following document with several bullet points.\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- A wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates, interest groups, unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle, an analysis shows. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year \u00bb . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\" \"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending \u00bb . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. \"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\" Tracey said. \"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. \"Politics is completely beholden to events,\" he said. \"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? \"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\n", "completion": "- Amount almost double what was spent in the 2004 election cycle.\n- Lower TV production costs help more candidates advertise.\n- Mitt Romney leads presidential candidates in TV spending.\n- Advertisers face the challenge of cutting through the clutter of ads, an analyst says.<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Analyze sales data and create a report with recommendations for improving revenue.\n", "completion": "Sales Report and Recommendations:\n\nBased on the sales data from the past quarter, it is evident that there has been a decline in revenue compared to the same period last year. The total revenue for this quarter was $500,000, which is a 10% decrease from last year's revenue of $550,000.\n\nUpon further analysis, it was found that the decrease in revenue can be attributed to a decrease in sales volume rather than a decrease in product prices. This indicates that there may be an issue with customer retention or acquisition.\n\nTo improve revenue, I recommend implementing the following strategies:\n\n1. Increase marketing efforts: It is important to reach out to potential customers and remind them of our products and services. This can be done through targeted social media campaigns, email marketing, and collaborations with influencers.\n\n2. Improve customer experience: Customer satisfaction plays a crucial role in retaining customers and attracting new ones. Conduct surveys to gather feedback and make necessary improvements to enhance the overall customer experience.\n\n3. Offer promotions and discounts: Customers are always attracted to good deals and discounts. Consider offering promotions or bundle deals to encourage more purchases.\n\n4. Expand product line: Diversifying our product line can attract new customers and also provide existing customers with more options to choose from. Market research can help identify potential new products that align with our brand and target audience.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, we can aim to increase sales volume and ultimately improve revenue. Regularly monitoring and analyzing sales data will also help us track the effectiveness of these strategies and make necessary adjustments.

{"prompt": "Research and present on the history and cultural significance of a traditional dance from a specific country.\n\n", "completion": "Traditional Dance: Hula\nCountry: Hawaii\n\nThe hula is a traditional dance form that originated in the Polynesian islands, specifically in Hawaii. It is a cultural and spiritual practice that has been passed down through generations and holds great significance in Hawaiian culture.\n\nThe origins of hula can be traced back to ancient times when it was performed as a ritual to honor the gods and goddesses of nature. It was also used as a form of storytelling, with dancers using hand gestures and body movements to convey stories and legends.\n\nIn the 19th century, hula faced suppression by Christian missionaries who saw it as a sinful and pagan practice. However, it experienced a revival in the early 20th century thanks to the efforts of King David Kalakaua, who promoted and preserved Hawaiian traditions and culture.\n\nToday, hula is still an important part of Hawaiian culture and is often performed at special occasions such as weddings, funerals, and festivals. It is also a popular tourist attraction, with many hula schools and performances available for visitors to experience.\n\nThe dance itself involves graceful and fluid movements of the hands, hips, and feet, accompanied by chanting and singing. The costumes worn by hula dancers are also significant, with different styles representing different meanings and purposes.\n\nOverall, hula remains an integral part of Hawaiian identity and serves as a way to connect with their ancestors, preserve their culture, and share their stories with the world.<|endoftext|>"}

Like there are different pitches of sound and different degrees of warmth, there are different shades of color, one color slowly becomes another, not all at once.\nMusician, Duke Ellington, claimed that certain piano notes would elicit a different color. For example, a D note would be a dark blue color. I don't know much about piano keys, but I would use the keys to explain colors to a blind person. A high key elicits a bright color, a low key elicits a dark color.\nMia lost her vision when she was young. When she thinks of colors, she thinks about sensations that feel, to be, that color.

They were fiercely determined to break free from British rule and were willing to sacrifice everything for their cause. We faced harsh conditions, lack of supplies, and constant attacks from guerrilla warfare tactics used by the colonists.\nDespite our initial advantages, the colonists' determination and resilience ultimately led to their victory. It was a humbling experience for us as we realized that we were fighting against fellow Englishmen who simply wanted to be free from oppression.

You may also find that it helps to keep an exercise diary. Record what you did during each exercise session, how long you exercised, and how you felt afterward. \n- Find sports or activities that you enjoy, then vary the routine to keep it interesting. Remember, exercise doesn't have to be boring, and you're more likely to stick with a fitness program if you're having fun.  \n- Make physical activity part of your daily routine. If it's hard to find time for exercise, don't fall back on excuses. Schedule workouts as you would any other important activity. \n-  Some people find it helpful to work out with a friend. Invite friends or co-workers to join you when you exercise or go on walks. Work out with your partner or other loved ones.\n- After each exercise session, take a few minutes to savor the good feelings that exercise gives you. This type of internal reward can help you make a long-term commitment to regular exercise. External rewards can help too. When you reach a longer-range goal, treat yourself to a new pair of walking shoes or new tunes to enjoy while you exercise.\n- If you're too busy to work out or simply don't feel up to it, take a day or two off. Go easy on yourself if you need a break. The important thing is to get back on track as soon as you can.\nThere are a variety of ways to stay motivated during a workout. Find what works best for you and stick with it.<|endoftext|>"}

It is caused by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions have led to rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events.\nThe consequences of climate change are far-reaching and devastating. Sea levels are rising, leading to coastal flooding and erosion. Natural disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts are becoming more frequent and severe. The loss of biodiversity and destruction of ecosystems also have significant impacts on our environment and economy.\nIt is crucial that we take action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. This includes reducing our carbon footprint through sustainable practices, investing in renewable energy sources, and protecting and restoring natural habitats. Governments, corporations, and individuals all have a role to play in addressing this crisis.\nFurthermore, it is important to recognize that marginalized communities and developing countries are disproportionately affected by climate change. We must prioritize equity and justice in our efforts to combat this issue.\nIn conclusion, climate change is a complex and urgent problem that requires immediate action. By working together and making changes in our daily lives, we can make a positive impact and create a better future for ourselves and generations to come.<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Task: Generate a title for the paper given a description or abstract of its content.\n\nAbstract: Fine-tuning continuous prompts for target tasks has recently emerged as a compact alternative to full model fine-tuning. Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.\n\n", "completion": "Prompt Waywardness: The Curious Case of Discretized Interpretation of Continuous Prompts<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Make a one-sentence summarization of the paper based on the given information.\n\nInput: Abstract: While many approaches to make neural networks more fathomable have been proposed, they are restricted to interrogating the network with input data. Measures for characterizing and monitoring structural properties, however, have not been developed. In this work, we propose neural persistence, a complexity measure for neural network architectures based on topological data analysis on weighted stratified graphs. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we show that neural persistence reflects best practices developed in the deep learning community such as dropout and batch normalization. Moreover, we derive a neural persistence-based stopping criterion that shortens the training process while achieving comparable accuracies as early stopping based on validation loss.\n\nOutput:", "completion": " We develop a new topological complexity measure for deep neural networks and demonstrate that it captures their salient properties.<|endoftext|>"}
